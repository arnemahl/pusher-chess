# Creating a real time chess game

Chess is a fascinating game of strategy between two players. And, as any multi-player game, it hugely benefits from having realtime updates of the game - both for players and for spectators.

This repository is discussed at [Creating a realtime chess game](https://pusher.com/tutorials/realtime-chess-game).

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

In order to use this, you will need a Pusher Channels and Pusher ChatKit application created, and to put the appropriate credentials into the placeholders found.

### Running

This project consists of a Backend service and a Webapp Service. These need to be independently built and started, and once both are running the game can be played.

For both of these, you will need to execute `yarn install` to download dependencies, and then `yarn start` to start the module running.

## Built With

* [Pusher](https://pusher.com/) - APIs to enable devs building realtime features
* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) - Node.jsÂ® is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine.
* [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) - Create React apps with no build configuration.
* [Express Generator](https://expressjs.com/en/starter/generator.html) - Use the application generator tool, express-generator, to quickly create an application skeleton.
